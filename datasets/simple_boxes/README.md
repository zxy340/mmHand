Simple boxes dataset is a generated dataset using the `generate.py` file.
It is a simplified dataset to verify models intended for hand detection.

There should be a folder named images containing the generated images.
Each image contains two circles. 
On top of that, bboxes.txt file is created during the generation that contains true 
bounding box labels for each image.

For more information, see `generate.py`.
